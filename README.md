🌿 Plant Species and Leaf Disease Classification

This repository contains the codebase for a Major Project by two final-year undergraduate students from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Adamas University, Kolkata, India:

Sarthak Shah

Tanbir Saha

📌 Project Overview

The aim of this project is to develop a deep learning-based system for plant species identification and leaf disease classification. It includes:

Custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models.

Transfer Learning using popular pre-trained models.

This project addresses the growing need for automated and efficient plant disease detection, which can assist farmers and agricultural experts in early diagnosis and better crop management.

📁 Repository Contents

Code for training and evaluating our custom CNN architectures.

Code implementing transfer learning with models such as MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB0 and ResNet50.

Final project presentation slides summarizing the objectives, methodology, results, and conclusions.
